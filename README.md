--------------------------------------------------------------------ML Projects (Python)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Various Machine Learning Projects exploring ML concepts in depth

- Project-1 - Linear Regression and Gradient Descent.
 
- Training two types of regression models Linear Regression and Gradient Descent using Iris Dataset. Linear Regression is a technique for forecasting real-world values given some input. To improve our linear model, we apply the gradient descent approach.

- Project-2 - Supervised Learning using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
 
- Training LDA models to determine which input variables make up the most effective linear combinations for separating distinct data classes.Based on their measurements,   the Iris dataset reliably categorizes iris flowers. It is good for datasets with many classes and tiny sample numbers.

- Project-3 - Multi-SVM and Non-Linear SVM in Random-Forest Classifier.
 
- For data that may be divided into many classes and that cannot be separated linearly, the classification techniques Multi SVM and Non-linear SVM are utilized. A non-linearly separable dataset for testing classification methods is produced using Scikit-learn's create Circles function. A Random Forest classifier trained on the Iris dataset have its decision boundary shown using an interactive 3D plot utilizing Plotly's Random Forest Visualization feature.

- Project-4 - Neural Network with Various Functions and Solving the XOR Problem in Handwritten Digit Recognition Dataset.
 
- When building a neural network, used a variety of activation functions to introduce non-linearity, including the sigmoid function and the hyperbolic tangent function. Also evaluated the difference between the predicted and actual output probabilities using the cross-entropy loss function and the softmax activation function for multi-class classification. Trained a neural network on a dataset of handwritten digit recognition to solve the XOR issue, and then used the backpropagation technique to change the network's weights and biases to reduce the loss function. Using these approaches, created a neural network capable of classifying handwritten digits and solving the XOR issue.

- Project-5 - Implementing Decision Trees, Random Forests, and AdaBoost on Titanic Dataset.
 
- The Titanic dataset is often used for classification problems, with the purpose of predicting whether or not a passenger survived based on various input variables. To address this issue, Â used the decision trees, random forests, and AdaBoost algorithms. Although decision trees are an easy-to-visualize, straightforward, and interpretable model, overfitting may occur. The overfitting issue isÂ reduced by random forests by combining the predictions of many decision trees, creating a more precise and reliable model. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning technique that iteratively develops weak classifiers and combines them into a stronger classifier. These methods enabledÂ to create models that accurately forecast the survival of Titanic passengers.

- Project-6 - Convolutional Neural Networks using TensorFlow: Basic CNN, All Convolutional Net, Regularization, and Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Resnet18 Model
 
- For image classification applications, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a common form of neural network. Used two convolutional layers to build a simple CNN, then three fully connected layers with the ReLU activation function to provide non-linearity. Three convolutional layers are used to create an All Convolutional Net, which is then followed by a pooling layer that makes use of the ReLU activation function. Three fully connected layers, two convolutional layers, and one additional convolutional layer are used to accomplish regularization. Last but not least, transfer learning is used with pre-trained models like ResNet18 to increase the model's accuracy by exploiting the learnt characteristics of the pre-trained model. Â Created efficient models for picture classification problems by utilizing these methods.
These designs are implemented using the well-liked framework TensorFlow, which is used for creating and training deep learning models.

React.Js project - Say It Right -
An app called Say It Right was created to teach users how to pronounce one other's names properly. React Native and Expo, which offer cross-platform compatibility for iOS and Android devices, are used to create the app in JavaScript. In addition to offering a phonetic spelling and audio guide for users to follow when pronouncing other people's names, the app employs voice recognition to enable users to record and playback their name pronunciation. With the use of these resources, Say It Right encourages tolerance and diversity in communication while offering people a simple, accessible way to learn how to pronounce names correctly.

Python project  -	Sharing of resources in Networked systems (Verbose Lamp) -

Python's multithreading feature permits the concurrent execution of several threads inside a single process, improving performance and resource efficiency. By enabling effective communication and data transmission across networked devices, using several socket connections concurrently can further improve this. Clients may access remote resources as if they were local because to location transparency, which gives distributed systems more flexibility and scalability. Directory synchronization can provide consistency between several systems, and replication implementation transparency can enable fault tolerance and redundancy. Mutual exclusion enables secure and effective concurrent access to shared resources by preventing race situations and data inconsistencies. Python has several built-in tools and modules for putting these ideas into practice, enabling strong and adaptable multithreaded programs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------Database Project------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DBMS project - Designed a Database System for a Motel Booking System using Omega Oracle(SQL).  

Designed a database system for a motel booking system using Omega Oracle and created a data model that captures the relationships between entities such as guests, rooms, reservations, and payments. The system enables effective data storage and retrieval while upholding data consistency and integrity with the use of restrictions and triggers. Data integrity is improved and redundancy is reduced by using normalization procedures. To secure sensitive data, the system also uses security features including access restriction and encryption. For developing, installing, and operating a reliable and scalable database system for a hotel booking system, Omega Oracle offers a variety of tools and functions.
